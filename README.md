# EU5 Leaderboard (web)

A static web page that builds a standings report from a Europa Universalis V
save — the player nations' population, tax base, armies, coats of arms, a
political map and a blood ledger. It's the browser version of
`eu5_leaderboard.py`: everything runs client-side in a Web Worker, so saves
are never uploaded and the site needs no server.

## Using it

1. Make a readable save: add `-debug_mode` to the game's Steam launch
   options, load your save and save again.
2. Open the page and drop the `.eu5` file on it.
3. *(Optional)* Click **Choose game folder** and pick the `game` folder
   inside your `Europa Universalis V` install. Coats of arms and the map are
   drawn from the game's own files, which are read locally and never
   redistributed. (The page uses a folder `<input>` rather than Chrome's
   directory picker, which refuses anything under `Program Files`.)
4. **Download report** saves a self-contained HTML file to share.
   **Download data** saves the numbers as JSON; drop that back on the page to
   rebuild the report without the save.

## How it works

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `css/app.css`, `js/app.js` | Page, file picking, report assembly |
| `js/worker.js` | Save parsing, stats, coat-of-arms rendering, map painting |
| `js/dds.js` | BC1/BC3/BC7 texture decoding for the coat-of-arms `.dds` files |
| `report-template.html` | The report page (same template as the Python script) |

Output matches the Python script: extracted numbers are identical, and the
map is within one colour level per pixel. Flags differ only by resampling
filter.

## Running locally

The page fetches its report template, so serve it over HTTP rather than
opening the file directly:

```
python -m http.server
```

then open http://localhost:8000.
